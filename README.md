# Image_Processing_with_Neighborhood_Processing_in_Verilog
The "Image Processing with Neighborhood Processing in Verilog" project is a fascinating exploration of digital image processing techn In this project, we focus on manipulating a well-known image, the Luna Gray image, to perform three fundamental image processing operations: blurring, edge detection, and sharpening.
